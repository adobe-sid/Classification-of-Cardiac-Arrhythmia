# Classification-of-Cardiac-Arrhythmia
Categorizing different categories of arrhythmia and for reducing the dimension six feature selection techniques (Random Forest, Variance Threshold, Analysis of Variance, CHI-2, dropping correlated features, and Recursive Feature Elimination) are applied in combination with fourteen classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,Gradient Boosting, Bagging, Na√Øve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor, LightGBM, ID3, Stacking, Maximum Voting, and Averaging) using Python language.The aim is to compare different classification algorithms to predict cardiac arrhythmia diseases. The performance parameters taken are accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score.
